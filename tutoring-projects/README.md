# Python Tutoring Projects
- This directory is for all of my example projects that I use 
when tutoring students in Python. I feel like the best of way of teaching
other kids how to code is by them challenging themselves to building projects
on their own. Whenver they are stuck, I can give them hints in order for them
to get to the end result until they get to the point where they can design 
solutions on their own.
