Lesson Objective: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
"""

"""
What is Object-Oriented Programming? 
- OOP is one of the most important software design principles in Python. The main purpose of OOP is that it is a way to
organize our code into data and objects. OOP requires us to separate different objects into different containers called
"classes" where these classes are in charge of one main functionality in the overall program. 
- Ex: An example of where OOP can help us is in designing a flower. You could write a program that has all the
functionality that you need in one file, but this will lead to disorganized code when our codebase grows over time. But
let's say that we use OOP. We can have one class for the petals, one class for the stem of the flower, and one class 
for the middle part of the flower. This allows us to organize our code in objects rather than in one file.

Parts of Object-Oriented Programming: 
1.) Classes - classes are the most high-level concept in OOP where it is the blueprint for specific objects, attributes, 
and functions. 
- Ex: There could be a Car() class that is the basic blueprint of a car.
2.) Objects - are specific instances of a class. 
- Ex: Inside of our car class, we could have a Toyota object, a Ferrari object, a Tesla object, etc.
3.) Methods/Functions - functions are are defined inside of a class that describes the behaviors of an object. 
- Ex: Inside of our Car() class, we could have a drive() function, a brake() function, etc. 
4.) Attributes - attributes are the properties or characteristics of a class. 
- Ex: Inside of our Car() class, we could have a color attribute, a speed attribute, etc.

"""
Python is one of the main programming languages that implements these OOP principles. Let's look at an example of 
OOP programming in action. 
"""

"""
Now, after seeing OOP programming in action, let's try to make our own class using an example of your choice. If you 
can't think of an example, you could make an example Car class with make and color attributes. 
Car Exercises: 
1.) Create a function called increase_speed() that takes in a parameter that increases the speed by that amount 
2.) Create a function called compare_speed() that takes in a Car as a parameter and checks to see if a car's speed is 
greater than, less than, or equal to the current car.
