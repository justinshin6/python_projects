Lesson Objective: Introduction to Turtle and Graphical User Interfaces
"""
"""
What is Turtle and what is a Graphical User Interface? 
- Turtle is a Python library that allows coders to output their code onto a screen which is called a graphical user 
interface to make games, projects, or whatever they like. 
Definition: Graphical User Interface - also known as a GUI, a graphical user interface is just a fancy term for a 
screen. In our past Python projects, we mainly just worked inside of the terminal to get the output that we want, but 
by using Turtle and GUI's, we can output things onto the screen without having to solely depend on the terminal.
