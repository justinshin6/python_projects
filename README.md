# Python Personal Projects
- This repository is just an avenue for me to create fun, interesting
Python mini-projects that I do in my free time. These projects not only are
indicators of when I try out new technologies in python, but it is also a 
good studying resource for me as I can go back to repositories when I am
confused about using a certain library or package.
