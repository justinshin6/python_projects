# Beautiful Soup Introduction

- This directory is all about web-scraping using Beautiful Soup. I always found 
web-scraping really interesting, so these are just some projects that I thought
were fun where I scared data from different websites to analyze data. Such 
projects include looking at the highest point totals in the YCombinator website, 
ranking the top 100 movies according to Empire, and making a billboard spotify 
playlist using the Billboard top 100 and Spotify.
